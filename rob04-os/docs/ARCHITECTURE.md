# Architecture Overview

Rob04 OS aims for a modular architecture with strong isolation boundaries and clear contracts.

## Kernel Layer

- Pluggable microkernel/hybrid design
- Preemptive multitasking, memory management, IPC
- Hardware abstraction for devices and power management

## System Services

- Process manager, storage manager, networking stack
- Security services: sandboxing, permissions, biometrics, crypto, firewall
- Update service with A/B partitions and rollback support

## Application Layer

- App sandbox with declarative capabilities
- Rob04 Store with signed packages and reproducible builds
- Container runtime for cross-ecosystem apps

## Compatibility Layer

- User-mode compatibility for selected Windows/Linux apps
- ABI surface mediated via translation/shims and sandbox boundaries

## UX Layer

- Composable UI framework (desktop/mobile)
- Accessibility-first: screen reader, high-contrast, magnification
- Input: keyboard, mouse, touch, pen, voice

## Developer Experience

- SDK with language bindings
- Robust terminal and scripting
- Virtualization for dev/test

## Observability

- System health, telemetry with privacy controls, crash reporting
