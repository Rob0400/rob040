# RFC-0001: Rob04 High-Level Architecture

- Author: Core Team
- Status: Draft
- Created: 2025-08-08

## Summary

Define a modular architecture for Rob04 OS spanning kernel, services, application, UX, and developer experience layers.

## Motivation

Provide a foundation that balances user experience, performance, security, and extensibility. Enable incremental delivery and parallel workstreams.

## Design

- Kernel: small, message-passing core with drivers mostly in user space
- IPC: capability-secured message passing
- Services: composable daemons with strict APIs
- Apps: sandboxed with declarative capabilities
- Updates: A/B partitions with verified boot and rollback
- Observability: privacy-preserving telemetry and health metrics

## Alternatives Considered

- Monolithic kernel (performance, harder to isolate)
- Pure microkernel (clean isolation, higher IPC cost)

## Security Considerations

- Principle of least privilege
- Mandatory code signing for system components
- Reproducible builds and SBOMs

## Open Questions

- Target architectures and reference hardware
- Compatibility layer scope
- UI framework selection
